									</a></h2>
									<p>The dataset from Connecticut State Police traffic stops provides valuable insights into various aspects of traffic enforcement. The goal of the analysis is to answer specific questions related to the frequency and type of stops, violations, and outcomes, while considering demographic factors like gender, age, and race.
										
										
										
										
									Key KPIs:
										
									
									
									1.	Total Stops Made: The total number of traffic stops conducted.
										
									
									
									2.	Total Tickets Issued: How many tickets were issued during the stops.
										
									
									
									3.	Average Age of Drivers: The average age of drivers involved in traffic stops.
										
									
									
									4.	Total Arrests: The total number of arrests made during these stops.
										
										
										
										
										
										Key Questions Answered Using the Dashboard:
										Traffic Violations by Driver's Gender:
										How do traffic violations vary by driver gender, and how can filtering by factors such as driver gender, age, or race provide a more focused analysis of violation trends?
										Stop Outcomes by Age Brackets:
										What are the stop outcomes based on different age brackets, and how can apply filters such as driver gender or contraband presence provide a clearer view of outcomes across age groups?
										Monthly Stop Trends:
										How do stop frequencies vary across different months of the year, and how can filtering by characteristics like age or race influence the trends observed over the months?
										 Violation Trends:
										What are the trends in different types of traffic violations, and how can apply filters for driver gender, age, or contraband presence reveal more specific violation patterns?
										 Daily Stop Trends:
										How do stop frequencies vary across different days of the week, and how can filtering by demographic factors or contraband found provide deeper insights into daily stop trends?
										<br />
									<br />
									Overall Summary:
This analysis suggests that traffic enforcement patterns are influenced by a variety of factors such as driver demographics (age, gender), time of year, and day of the week. Key trends point to a high incidence of speeding violations, with male and younger drivers being more frequently involved in violations. Traffic stops are more common during peak months (e.g., March, October) and weekdays (especially Friday and Saturday), indicating that law enforcement activities are higher during these periods.

									<p>This dataset appears to track product orders from customers, capturing details about individual transactions. Outcome Analysis Using Dashboard Insights:
										
										
										
										KEY KPIs:
										•	Total Price: Total amount spent on orders.
										•	Total Items: Total quantity of items purchased.
										•	Total Discount: Total value of discounts applied.
										•	Total Revenue: Total revenue generated after discounts.
										Dashboard Questions with KPIs Integration:
										1.	Amount of Orders Made in Each Region Based on Gender: How do the total order price, item count, discount amount, and revenue vary by gender across different regions?
										o	This analysis will allow you to examine how these key metrics differ by gender in each region, providing insights into purchasing behaviors.
										2.	Monthly Analysis: How do the total order price, items purchased, discounts, and revenue change over the months?
										o	This analysis will highlight monthly trends and fluctuations in key metrics, helping to identify high-sales periods or low-activity months.
										3.	Daily Analysis: What are the daily trends in order price, item quantity, discounts, and revenue?
										o	This allows for a deeper dive into day-to-day patterns in sales and consumer behavior, helping pinpoint peak shopping days.
										4.	Total Orders Made in Each Region Contained in the Dataset: What is the total number of orders and how do they break down by price, items, discount value, and revenue across different regions?
										o	This analysis will provide an overview of total orders in each region, highlighting key performance indicators for each region’s sales activity.
										Other Additional Questions?
										 What is the total number of items, categorized by billing status (gross, net, valid)?
										What are the regional price trends based on different payment methods?
										What is the total revenue generated by various age segments?

									<p>In this project, I analyzed four datasets containing information on pizza sales and customer insights. The datasets were imported into SQL to address key business questions related to pizza sales performance and customer behavior. The analysis explored aspects such as average pizza price, order frequency by type, revenue generation by month, peak order days, and price variations across the menu.
